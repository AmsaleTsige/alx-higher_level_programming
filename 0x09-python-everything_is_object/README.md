0x09. Python - Everything is object
Description
What you should learn from this project:

Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :)) What is an object What is the difference between a class and an object or instance What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object What is a reference What is an assignment What is an alias How to know if two variables are identical How to know if two variables are linked to the same object How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation) What is mutable and immutable What are the built-in mutable types What are the built-in immutable types How does Python pass variables to functions

0. Who am I?
What function would you use to print the type of an object?
1. Where are you?
How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
2. Right count
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
3. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
4. Right count =
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.
5. Right count =+
In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

19. Copy a list object
Write a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.
20. Tuple or not?
a = ()
21. Tuple or not?
a = (1, 2)
22. Tuple or not?
a = (1)
23. Tuple or not?
a = (1, )
